          <h1>Who is this guy, anyway?</h1>
          <p>I'm a husband who loves his wife, dog, and cat. I'm just out here lookin' for adventure, man. Our lives are a gift. To waste them on waiting for retirement to be happy is not only frowned upon, but downright gross.</p>
          <p>People are important to me. The only way we will change the world is by investing in people. Practice random acts of kindness</p>

      <div class="location-section">
          <h1>Where do I live?</h1>
          <p>I hail from a city perched on the bluffs overlooking the Missouri river, or "Mighty MO" as we local folk call it. Don't worry, it's nowhere near as exotic as where you live. No Mark Twain stories here, just good ol' Saint Joseph, Missouri.</p>

          <h1>More About Me</h1>
          <h2>What are my favorite hobbies?</h2>
          <p>I enjoy sports, travel, and reading. My wife and I intend to see all seven continents. If God wills it. </p>
          <h2>What is my dream job?</h2>
          <p>Any job that affords passion, time, and mobility is a winner in my book. If it makes you happy and you can somehow aquire currency doing it, rock on.</p>
          <h2>What music have I been listening to lately?</h2>
          <p>Imagine the largest Pandora shuffle party of your life, and then you've somewhat tapped into my musical taste.</p>
